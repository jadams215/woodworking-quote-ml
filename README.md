# 🪚 Woodworking Quote Prediction Model (In Progress)

This project is an experiment in using **machine learning** (CatBoost) to predict woodworking job quotes.  
Since real historical job data is not yet available, the current version uses **synthetic random data** for testing.

---

## 📂 Project Status
- ✅ Synthetic dataset generated (100 random jobs between $500 – $500,000)
- ✅ Training pipeline with CatBoost (`train_catboost.py`)
- ✅ Model evaluation with RMSE & R²
- ✅ Visualizations (`analyze_model.py`) for feature importance, predicted vs actual, and error distribution
- ⏳ Awaiting real data to replace synthetic dataset
- ⏳ Interactive predictions (`predict_quote.py`) planned but not implemented yet

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Train the model
Run the training script on the synthetic dataset:
```bash
python train_catboost.py


This will:

Load the synthetic CSV

Train a CatBoost regression model

Print metrics (RMSE, R²)

Save the model file wood_quote_model.cbm

2. Analyze results

Run:

python analyze_model.py


This will:

Reload the trained model and dataset

Print performance metrics

Generate and save plots:

feature_importance.png

predicted_vs_actual.png

error_histogram.png

📊 Example Results (Synthetic Data)

Model Performance:

RMSE: ~136,000
R²: ~0.07


(Low accuracy expected since data is random noise — this will improve with real job data.)

## 📊 Visualizations

The following plots are generated by `analyze_model.py` and saved as PNGs.  
They help explain how the model performs and which features matter most.

---

### 🔹 Feature Importance
Shows which features drive predictions the most.

---

### 🔹 Predicted vs Actual
Diagonal = perfect predictions. Points closer to the red dashed line are more accurate.

---

### 🔹 Error Distribution
Histogram of (Actual − Predicted). A tight spread around 0 = better performance.

---

### 🔹 Correlation Heatmap
Relationship strength between all numeric features.

---

### 🔹 Partial Dependence Plot (Labor Hours)
Impact of estimated labor hours on predicted quote price.

---

### 🔹 Residuals vs Predicted
Shows where the model under- or over-predicts quotes.

---

### 🔹 Distribution of Actual vs Predicted Quotes
Checks whether the model predicts within the same range as actual quotes.

---

### 🔹 Feature Interaction (Labor Hours vs Quote Price)
How labor hours relate to price — actual vs predicted.

### 🔹 SHAP Summary Plot
Explains how features contribute to individual predictions.

🛠 Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

Pandas for data handling

Scikit-learn for metrics

CatBoost for modeling

Matplotlib for plots

📌 Next Steps

Replace synthetic data with real woodworking job dataset

Implement interactive quoting tool (predict_quote.py)

Compare CatBoost with XGBoost and Random Forest

Clean and standardize real-world inputs (wood species, install flag, dimensions)

Consider deployment as a small API or quoting assistant
